# Employee Incentive Application üèÖ (Conceptual)

## Problem / Need
- Incentive calculations were spreadsheet‚Äëdriven, error‚Äëprone, and slow, causing payout disputes and low trust.

## My Role
- Standardized rules, documented PRD/BRD, coordinated with dev & HR/Finance, and led UAT + rollout.

## Solution
- Rule engine to configure incentive logic per role/region.
- Data validation, audit trail, and approvals.
- Dashboard: payout accuracy, pending reviews, exception handling.

## Outcome / Impact
- Fewer errors, faster payouts, and improved employee satisfaction.
- Reduced monthly processing effort (insert % if available).
