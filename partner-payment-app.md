# Partner Payment Application üí≥ (Conceptual)

## Problem / Need
- Manual partner payment calculations led to **high error rates**, **data loss**, and **TAT > 10 days** after clearances.
- Approval matrix was vague; invoice rectifications added more delays and cycles.

## My Role
- Identified bottlenecks; designed a **risk‚Äëminimizing, compliant workflow matrix**.
- Authored the **BRD**, collaborated with developers, and led **UAT at each stage**.
- Coordinated stakeholder reviews, incorporated feedback, and drove the final launch.

## Solution
- Automated calculations with an **approval‚Äëdriven workflow**.
- Introduced **e‚ÄëSign for invoicing** to speed approvals and payment clearance.
- **Live updates** to clients on invoice status (accepted/rejected) with **instant re‚Äëapply** on rejection.
- **Dashboards** showing:
  - Status: *Yet to be initiated ‚Ä¢ Initiated ‚Ä¢ WIP ‚Ä¢ Paid*
  - **TAT by approving authority**
  - Real‚Äëtime stakeholder reports and transparency for clients.

## Outcome / Impact
- ‚úÖ **100% accuracy** in payments
- ‚è± **90% reduction in TAT** (from ~10 days to <1 day)
- ‚ö° Faster clearance via e‚ÄëSign; fewer back‚Äëand‚Äëforth cycles
- üôå Higher partner trust and stakeholder transparency
