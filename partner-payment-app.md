### Problem / Need
At my workplace, partner payment processing involved **high-volume manual calculations**, a **vague approval matrix**, and frequent **data losses** and **errors**. Turnaround time (TAT) stretched to **10+ days** after clearances. Incorrect invoices further added to delays, creating inefficiency, compliance risks, and partner dissatisfaction.

### My Role
- Identified bottlenecks and mapped the broken workflow.  
- Designed a **workflow matrix** to minimize risks while ensuring compliance.  
- Authored a detailed **Business Requirement Document (BRD)** and collaborated with developers.  
- Led **UAT (User Acceptance Testing)** at each stage to ensure data integrity and process alignment.  
- Coordinated stakeholder reviews, incorporated feedback, and drove the final launch.  

### Solution
- Automated partner payment calculations with an **approval-driven workflow**.  
- Introduced **e-Sign feature for invoicing**, streamlining approvals and accelerating payment clearance.  
- Enabled clients to receive **live updates on invoice status** (accepted/rejected).  
- Allowed **instant re-application of rejected invoices**, cutting down wait cycles.  
- Built in **data dashboards** to show:  
  - Status (yet-to-be-initiated, initiated, WIP, paid).  
  - TAT by each approving authority.  
  - Real-time reporting for stakeholders.  
- Provided **transparent tracking** for both stakeholders and clients.  

### Outcome / Impact
- ‚úÖ **100% accuracy** in partner payment processing.  
- ‚è± **90% reduction in TAT** (from ~10 days to <1 day).  
- ‚ö° Faster clearance through **e-Sign integration**.  
- üôå Clients experienced reduced friction with **instant re-application** and **live visibility**.  
- üí∞ Cost-efficient system that boosted transparency, compliance, efficiency, and trust with partners.
