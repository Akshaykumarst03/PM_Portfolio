# BRD Sample (Redacted/Conceptual)

## 1. Objective
Automate partner payment calculations with a compliant, auditable approval workflow and real‑time transparency.

## 2. Scope (In)
- Calculation engine for partner payouts
- Approval matrix with role‑based steps
- e‑Sign for invoice approvals
- Status dashboard + TAT metrics
- Reports export (CSV/PDF)

## 3. Scope (Out)
- Actual partner data, proprietary formulas, and internal systems (redacted)

## 4. Assumptions & Constraints
- Multi‑role approvals; audit logging required
- Dummy data used for prototypes

## 5. High‑Level Flow
1) Partner submits invoice → 2) Auto validation → 3) Approver 1 → 4) Approver 2 (if needed) → 5) e‑Sign → 6) Payment queued → 7) Status & notifications

## 6. User Stories (Samples)
- As an approver, I want to see pending invoices with SLA timers so I can prioritize.
- As a partner, I want instant visibility if an invoice is rejected and a way to re‑submit immediately.
- As ops, I want TAT by approver so I can identify bottlenecks.

## 7. Acceptance Criteria (Samples)
- Rejected invoice triggers reason + re‑apply flow within 1 click.
- e‑Sign completion updates status within 60 seconds.
- Dashboard reflects status counts and TAT by role.

## 8. Metrics
- TAT reduction, accuracy %, % auto‑approved, # re‑applies, approver SLAs.
