# Partner Onboarding Application 🤝 (Conceptual)

## Problem / Need
- Onboarding was manual with fragmented KYC/document checks leading to long cycle times and drop‑offs.

## My Role
- Led requirements, mapped end‑to‑end flow, coordinated with compliance/ops, designed guided steps, and managed UAT.

## Solution
- Guided onboarding wizard with document upload, validation, e‑Sign, and role‑based approvals.
- Real‑time tracking for partners; SLA visibility for ops; alerts for missing items.

## Outcome / Impact
- Onboarding time reduced from days to hours; improved partner experience and transparency.
